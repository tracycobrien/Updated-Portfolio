# Updated-Portfolio

### Overview
My updated portfolio is still a work in progress. I have made an effort to rework the portfolio page to reflect my personal style. I plan to continue working on this as the class progresses. 

#### Content

You will find the following on my page:

* name

* Links to my GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number 
https://www.linkedin.com/in/tracy-o-brien/
https://github.com/tracycobrien

* A link to a PDF of your resume https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qmcWRrJnNEAiFz6_VRI-_NvzlhvtyVvE

* List of projects. For each project I have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the code on GitHub

#### Design

I have worked to meet the design basics below:
The content of your portfolio page is a lot more important than the aesthetics. That said, there are a couple basic requirements your portfolio page should meet:

* Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes

* Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
